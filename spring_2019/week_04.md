## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I worked on the padding for the Spotify widget. I discovered a new way to paste a widget ontop of an article page using Bootstrap. Instead of a fixed position, I am using a sticky position. This now restricts the widget from blocking other text blocks located in the footer of an article page. However, this has made me realize that the column the widget is located in isn't formatted correctly. Some of the article text is being pushed down due to the widget.

## This Week's Plan

> I want to finish formatting the Spotify widget, and hopefully start implementing something new. I've been stuck on this problem for a while now because I need to keep referencing Bootstrap documentation.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing really. I still don't know everything about Bootstrap so my formatting isn't the most effecient as of now.
