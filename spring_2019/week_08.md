## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I started working on a new widget to embed within articles. I researched some form formats, and played around with adding a form block to the article page model.

## This Week's Plan

> I plan on messing around more with this form widget this week, and seeing how the layout looks. I also need to talk to other editors to get feedback on what styling they want for this built in form.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing really.
