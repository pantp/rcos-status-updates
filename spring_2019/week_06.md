## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I attempted to make the Spotify and Youtube widgets responsive to smaller screens, but am not finished with this task. It is proving harder to do because of the "position:sticky" tag I am using to post these widgets on the article page. I am using the staff page as a reference since I was able to make those columns responsive.

## This Week's Plan

> I am in the process of getting feedback on the documentation I have written so far. Once I fix some smaller bugs, I will start implementing another feature. One I have in mind is a comments or feedback section within articles.

## Anything Blocking?

> I need my branches to be reviewed, which may help me fix my responsive screen bugs.
