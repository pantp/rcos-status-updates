## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I was able to integrate Youtube videos in the same way I added the Spotify widget to the article page type. This will be helpful if a reader wants to watch the trailer associated with the movie/TV series review. Additionally, I committed some changes to my branches regarding Spotify and Youtube video widgets. I fixed the padding issues, and am satisfied with these widgets for now. Hopefully, the branches will be ready to be merged in once some minor build errors are fixed.

## This Week's Plan

> One thing I forgot about both widgets is how to handle viewing in a smaller screen. I would just have to make the widgets responsive, which shouldn't be too hard (probably). I plan on focusing on that this week. Additionally, I am in the process of getting feedback on the documentation I have written so far.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing really. I need to read Bootstrap documentation on responsive screens.
