## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I changed the Youtube widget formatting so that it shows up as a block embedded within the article itself. Before, the widget showed up as a floating, sticky component that traveled with the reader. That didn't make sense for the purpose the widget serves. It is better for it to be a stationary component within the article.

## This Week's Plan

> I am in the process of getting feedback on the documentation I have written so far. I will transition to implementing some other feature, and still need my current branches reviewed. There are probably bugs I need to fix in those branches.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing really.
