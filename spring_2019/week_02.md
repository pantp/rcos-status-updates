## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I created a few initial files for documentation, and pushed them to a new branch. I started filling these out, and need to ask Sid about the format of these files. I also began looking into Bootstrap's padding so I can finish formatting the Spotify widget.

## This Week's Plan

> I will continue writing documentation this week. More specifically, I want to finish describing Wagtail's tree structure as well as defining how to create a new article and save it in a specific section. I also want to ask staff members how they feel about the documentation, and whether it will be helpful for potential new members.

## Anything Blocking?

> I need to talk to Sid about some specifics regarding documentation. There are some features I am unfamiliar, and therefore do not know how to describe them. I plan on asking him during the next small group meeting.
