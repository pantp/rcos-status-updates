## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I finished a few documentation files I was working on, including the ones describing Wagtail's tree structure and defining how to create a new article. I also asked for initial feedback from staff members about the format. Additionally, I read through some documentation Wagtail provides for new editors. However, I found that this was too dense, and might be overwhelming for someone to look at initially. I began pulling out some specific information they provided so that readers can quickly read a summary.

## This Week's Plan

> I will continue writing documentation. I still need to finish padding and formatting the Spotify widget. That is something I haven't figured out how to do yet despite reading up on Bootstrap documentation.

## Anything Blocking?

> Small group was cancelled last week so I still need to talk to Sid. There are some features I am unfamiliar, and therefore do not know how to describe them in the documentation. I plan on asking him during this week's small group.
