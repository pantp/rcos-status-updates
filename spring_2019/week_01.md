## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I finished the functionality of the spotify widget I was working on for Pipeline features late last semester. I also started looking into bettering documentation for Pipeline. My plan is to make small files that each show the reader how to do certain tasks within Pipeline.

## This Week's Plan

> I still need to format the spotify widget and fix how it shows up on the article page. I believe I need to pad it so it stops scrolling at a certain point. Also, I need to think about how the widget will look on a mobile page. However, I intend on taking a break from this and focusing on Pipeline documentation for this week.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing blocking as of now. I just need to continue reading Bootstrap's documentation so I learn about margins and padding.
