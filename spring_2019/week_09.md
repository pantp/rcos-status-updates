## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I spent some time resolving merge conflicts within my branches and master. This took longer than expected, and I came across some errors I am unfamiliar with.

## This Week's Plan

> I need to ask for help regarding the merge conflict errors. I will then continue work on implementing wagtail forms within articles. I also need to start working on my RCOS presentation for next week.

## Anything Blocking?

> I need to ask Sid about the merge conflict errors I'm getting.
