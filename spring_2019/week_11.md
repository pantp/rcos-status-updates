## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Sid and I had our presenation this Tuesday. We worked to finish the presentation and demo before then.

## This Week's Plan

> I don't have a concrete goal in mind. I should look into Wagtail's Forms. Also, we have some styling issues to deal with since we are deploying Pipeline soon.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing really.
