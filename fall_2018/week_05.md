## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I found a NLP repo to use for selecting keywords out of a large textfield. This is important for the related articles feature because it will allow me to find articles with similar keywords. I also worked on layout for the staff page and made changes to the current layout. This helped me relearn HTML skills I haven't used in years.

## This Week's Plan

> I am working on implementing finding related articles with the new NLP repo I found. I will also continue to update the staff/staff index pages layout. I am also in the process of relearning HTML and basic web development.

## Anything Blocking?

> I need some clarification about previous implementation in pipeline and will dicuss this in small group.
