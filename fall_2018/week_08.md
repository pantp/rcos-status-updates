## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I wrote an algorithm for finding words within given text. Right now, I am having trouble integrating this algorithm with the existing models that represent our data. I have been messing around with this problem for a few days now, and will get clarification on it during small group. I also made more changes to the staff page layout pull request I openned.

## This Week's Plan

> I need to finish the minor changes on the staff page layout pull request so it can be merged in. Then, I will go back to the problems I am having with integrating my new code with existing models.

## Anything Blocking?

> I am having some trouble with the existing models, and need to ask my team about those.
