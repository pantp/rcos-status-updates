## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I didn't acheive as much as I would've liked to last week. I was in Texas attending Grace Hopper, and only had time to look through the repository some more.

## This Week's Plan

> I plan on deciding what specifically I want to work on for the poly website. I also need help with my Pipeline environment, and am going to fix that this week.

## Anything Blocking?

> I am having trouble with running Pipeline on my laptop. This is mainly because I was not on campus last week and couldn't reach out for help during small group.
