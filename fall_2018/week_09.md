## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week was Thanksgiving break so I didn't have as much time to work on Pipeline. However, one of the branches I was working on just got merged into master. This was for the individual staff page layout.

## This Week's Plan

> I have to resolve a conflict on the branch I am working on currently before this one also is merged into master.

## Anything Blocking?

> I need to ask my team about how to run a file through black formatting. I am unsure how to do this.
