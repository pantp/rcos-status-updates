## Last Week's Accomplishments

> All the branches I was working on have successfully been merged into master. There was an issue I had with the Travis CI build failing for one of my branches. I was able to decipher the error message, and fix the NoneType error I was getting.

## This Week's Plan

> I need to work on the presentation for RCOS large group. We are presenting next week. I may also add some smaller formatting changes to our leading section pages before the semester ends.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing really, just need to touch base with my group about our presentation.
