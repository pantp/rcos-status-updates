## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I worked on finding related articles for the article the viewer is currently reading. I have a function set up and am reading through existing code to implement this feature.

## This Week's Plan

> I am going to look into python's existing libraries to match articles using keywords. I also am going to start working on organizing styling for author pages.

## Anything Blocking?

> I got help I needed during small group and will reach out if I need anything else.
