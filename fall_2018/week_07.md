## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I committed more changes to the individual staff page layout. When minimizing the screen, the columns now stack in the desired format. Also, the font of article titles are now smaller than the author name.

## This Week's Plan

> I need to go back and focus on the NLP function for finding related articles. I also want to see if the staff page can be formatted better to fill more of the page with article names instead of blank space.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing at the moment. I do want to get advice from my group on how they want to fill the staff page blank space.
