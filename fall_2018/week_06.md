## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I read documentation about styling HTML code and messed around with the existing code for staff pages. I want to make multiple columns that change their layout when the screen size is modified. The hardest part has been working with the preexisting django template while incorporating new features.

## This Week's Plan

> I need to work on the NLP function; I chose not to focus on that last week. I also plan on learning more about HTML styling.

## Anything Blocking?

> Reading through HTML documentation is taking me a while. I'm not familiar with styling and so learning that has slowed down the process.
