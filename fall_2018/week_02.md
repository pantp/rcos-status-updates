## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I got the help I needed and now am able to run pipeline on my laptop. I started looking into the various components of our local host webpage.

## This Week's Plan

> I am going to mess around with the admin page on pipeline and make some changes or suggestions.

## Anything Blocking?

> I need to still familiarize myself with the way pipeline is set up and running.
