## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I helped with the presentation for large group.

## This Week's Plan

> I will try to make more layout changes to section pages, and see what other features can be updated. My team discussed maybe putting in a panel/column on the features page to see what is happening around RPI. That is something I will look into implementing or at least starting before the semester ends.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing really, I need to touch base with my group about our presentation.
