## Last Week's Accomplishments

> My group presented in large group. I also started working on adding a spotify widget to any articles about media. I want to add a small bar running across the top or the bottom of the article page, where readers can play the album they are reading about.

## This Week's Plan

> I don't know if I will have time this week to finish working on this widget, but I have committed my thoughts/progress so far.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing really, I plan on talking to the Poly staff how they would like the spotify widget formatted on the article page.
